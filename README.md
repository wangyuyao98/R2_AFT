# R-squared measure for AFT model

The repository contains code for implementing the R-squared measure for AFT model proposed in the Chan et. al (2018) paper [DOI: 10.1080/03610918.2016.1177072](https://doi.org/10.1080/03610918.2016.1177072).

We use the `ovarian` data set from the `survival` R package as an illustration.
