# R-squared measure for AFT model

The repository contains the R package 'aftR2' for computing the R-squared measure for AFT model proposed in the Chan et. al (2018) paper [DOI: 10.1080/03610918.2016.1177072](https://doi.org/10.1080/03610918.2016.1177072).

We use the `ovarian` data set from the `survival` R package as an illustration.
The R package is under the folder `aftR2`. The function in the package for computing the R-sqaured measure is `aftR2()`. The code is in the 'aftR2/R/' folder, and the description of the function and an example of the usage of this function is in the 'aftR2/man/' folder.
